[*8 Relay Control Board (SPX-24475)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/24475)

A simple breakout for controlling 8 relays with logic level signals. Each relay channel is opto-isolated from its corresponding logic input, the inputs accept both 3V and 5V logic, and a status LED on each channel makes it easy to tell at a glance which relay is energized. All LEDs on the board, including the power indicator, are connected through cuttable solder jumpers so they can be disabled if you don't need them. The relays are rated to 5A/250VAC, making them useful for a lot of power control applications.
